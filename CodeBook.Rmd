##### Feature abbreviation key:
```Shell
t       = Time
f       = Frequency, obtained by Fast Fourier Transform
X       = X dimensional axis
Y       = Y dimensional axis
Z       = Z dimensional axis
Acc     = Acceleration
Mag     = Magnitude
std     = Standard deviation
Body    = Human body of subject
Gyro    = Gyroscope
Jerk    = Jerk signal of linear body acceleration signal and angular velocity
mean    = Mean value
Gravity = Gravity acceleration
```

```{r displayFeatureData, echo = FALSE}
desc <- c("Mean of body linear acceleration measured on X-axis")
as.data.frame(mean.std.features)
